#web-historian
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.

#Summary
This application was designed to 'ask' a website for its HTML. It would then store the website in an archive, hence the historian.
